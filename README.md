# Probability and Statistics

## Projects

#### Binomial Distrubtion

Simulating coin flips involving fair and unfair coins. 

#### Random Variable Distribution

Working with measurements of body dimensions. The data set contains measurements from 247 men and 260 women, most of whom were considered healthy young adults.
Plotting and comparing data for height, weight, age, chest depth, elbow diameter, knee diameter, bi-illiace diameter and more.
Plots used includes histograms and normal qq plots (norm and line)
Determining whether these random variables follow a normal distribution or not

#### Statistical Inference

Investigating the ways in which the statistic from a random sample of data can serve as point estimates for population parameters. Interested in formulation a sampling distribution of our estimate in order to learn about the properties (such as the distribution) of the estimate.
Working with real estate data from the city of Ames, Iwoa. The details of every real estate transaction in Ames is recorded by the City Assessor's office. Our particular focus will be all residential home sales in Ames between 2006 and 2010. This collection represents our population of interesst. We would like to learn about these home sales by taking smaller samples from the full population.
We have the entire population but that is rarely the case in real life so we will randomly sample a part of the population to understand the properites of sampling.
